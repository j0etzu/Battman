### Advantages
- [x] Purely constructed with Objective-C & C
- [x] UI purely written with brilliant Objective-C codes
- [x] NO StoryBoards, NO additional binaries, NO Xcode Assets
- [x] NO nasty Swift and SwiftUI involved
- [x] NEITHER Swift NOR SwiftUI involved, they are disgusting
- [x] NO CocoaPods, NO Swift Packages, NO external code requirements, NO 3rd-party frameworks
- [x] Compile WITH/WITHOUT Xcode
- [x] Builds on Linux (Yes, "you need Mac to make iOS apps" is Apple propaganda)
- [x] Obtain & Operate directly from/with your hardware with the deepest raw data
- [x] Supporting iPhone & iPad & iPod & Xcode Simulator & Apple Silicon Macs (If someone donate devices I can even code for Apple Watches and Apple TVs)
- [x] Highly integrated with your battery Gas Gauge IC that manufactured by Texas Instruments
- [x] Show as much as power informations than IOPS & PowerManagement provided
- [x] Identifying your power adapters, wireless chargers, or even your MagSafe accessories

### Only Battman Can Do

What other battery utils made for iOS hasn‚Äôt done
(As of 9th Sun Mar 2025 UTC+0)
- [x] Complete NotChargingReason decoding (see [not_charging_reason.h](Battman/battery_utils/not_charging_reason.h))
- [x] Texas Intruments Impedance Track‚Ñ¢ information retrieving
- [x] Real-time charging current/voltage reading
- [x] Running perfectly when in Xcode Simulator (Other people uses IOPS in their app so not working in Sims)
- [x] Smart Charging (Optimized Battery Charging) communication
- [x] Low Power Mode behavior control
- [x] Detailed information for attached MagSafe Accessories
- [x] Detailed information for attached Lightning Cables & Accessories
- [x] Read all hardware temperature sensors

### Requirements

- Jailbroken or install with TrollStore
- iOS 12+ / macOS 11+ (backports welcomed)
- arm64 (A7+ theoretically / M1+)
- Gettext libintl (Optional, for localizations)
- GTK+ 3 (Optional, for running under GTK+ based WM)

### Download

I don't provide prebuilts at current stage, Battman is still not as completed as how I thought. If you really desired to use Battman, build by yourself or contact me for a prebuilt package.

```bash
# On macOS, install Xcode and directly build in it
# On Linux or BSD, make sure a LLVM cross toolchain and iPhoneOS.sdk is prepared, modify Battman/Makefile if needed
# On iOS, when you using Torrekie/Comdartiwerk as bootstrap
apt install git odcctools bash clang make sed grep ld64 ldid libintl-dev iphoneos.sdk
git clone https://github.com/Torrekie/Battman
cd Battman
# If Targeting iOS 12 or ealier, download SF-Pro-Display-Regular.otf somewhere, and put it under Battman/
wget <https://LINK/OF/SF-Pro-Display-Regular.otf> -O Battman/SF-Pro-Display-Regular.otf
make -C Battman all
# Produced Battman.ipa will under $(CWD)/Battman/build/Battman.ipa
```

### Known Issues

- Battman is not actually integrated with hardware when running under devices with A7 to A10, since there has no AppleSMC, instead they uses AppleHPM which we cannot test.

### Tested Devices
- iPhone 12 Series (D52)
- iPad Pro 2021 3th Gen (J51)
- iPhone XR
- iPad Air 2

Please file [issues](../../issues/new) if Battman not working correctly on your device

### TODO
- [ ] AppKit/Cocoa UI for macOS
- [ ] GTK+/X11 UI for iOS/macOS
- [ ] Auto identify Gas Gauge IC
- [ ] Optional data collection (For decoding currently unknown params)
- [x] Advanced features (AppleSMC/ApplePMGR interface)
- [x] Thermal control
- [ ] Run as CLI
- [ ] Run as daemon
- [x] Charge limit
- [x] Wireless/MagSafe integration
- [ ] App rate limit
- [ ] Jetsam control
- [ ] Fan control
- [ ] Bluetooth accessories (AirPods, etc.)

MIT for now, may become [non-free license](LICENSE/LICENSE.md) later (at least MIT for now), you won't blame me if I want to make living with this right?
